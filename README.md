# UNet-Semantic-Segmentation-Aerial-Imagery

In image segmentation, transfer learning helps deep learning models perform more accurately. This project focuses on the segmentation of satellite images and finding the best transfer learning technique with U-Net for precise image segmentation. 

ðŸ”¹ Accuracy U-Net: 77%

ðŸ”¹ Accuracy InceptionResNetV2: 87%

âš¡ Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/humansintheloop/semantic-segmentation-of-aerial-imagery

âš¡ The total volume of the dataset is 72 images grouped into 6 larger tiles => cut up images into 256x256 pieces to create a larger training set

âš¡ The dataset consists of aerial imagery of Dubai obtained by MBRSC satellites and annotated with pixel-wise semantic segmentation in 6 classes:
