# UNet-Semantic-Segmentation-Aerial-Imagery

In image segmentation, transfer learning helps deep learning models perform more accurately. This project focuses on the segmentation of satellite images and finding the best transfer learning technique with U-Net for precise image segmentation. Three approaches of transfer learning including pre-trained VGG19, InceptionResNetV2, and EfficientNet models were used. Visual results and dice coefficients of the models were compared. " " showed more accurate performances.
